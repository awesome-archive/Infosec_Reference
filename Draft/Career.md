		* Some people enter the technology industry to build newer, more exciting kinds of technology as quickly as possible. My keynote will savage these people and will burn important professional bridges, likely forcing me to join a monastery or another penance-focused organization. In my keynote, I will explain why the proliferation of ubiquitous technology is good in the same sense that ubiquitous Venus weather would be good, i.e., not good at all. Using case studies involving machine learning and other hastily-executed figments of Silicon Valley’s imagination, I will explain why computer security (and larger notions of ethical computing) are difficult to achieve if developers insist on literally not questioning anything that they do since even brief introspection would reduce the frequency of git commits. At some point, my microphone will be cut off, possibly by hotel management, but possibly by myself, because microphones are technology and we need to reclaim the stark purity that emerges from amplifying our voices using rams’ horns and sheets of papyrus rolled into cone shapes. I will explain why papyrus cones are not vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks, and then I will conclude by observing that my new start-up papyr.us is looking for talented full-stack developers who are comfortable executing computational tasks on an abacus or several nearby sticks.
	* **Educational/Informational**
		* [Navigating Career Choices in InfoSec - Fernando Montenegro - BSides Detroit2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM2xCjrQSY4)
			* Making career choices can be intimidating and stressful. Perhaps this presentation can help. The tidal forces affecting technology impact our careers as well. If we're not actively managing them, we're leaving decisions to chance (or to others), and may not like the outcomes. This presentation describes a framework I've used over the past few years to evaluate both ongoing job satisfaction as well as new opportunities as they appear. I'm happy with the outcomes I've obtained with it, and have used this same framework when providing advice to others, and it has been well received. Hopefully it can help others as well.
		* [Infosec Tools of the Trade: Getting Your Hands Dirty](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/bsidesnashville2017/bsides-nashville-2017-green00-infosec-tools-of-the-trade-getting-your-hands-dirty-jason-smith-and-tara-wink)
			* In this presentation we'll will be going over introductions to the various focuses in information security and demoing the most common tools that are used in operational security, both offense and defense. You'll leave with an idea on how to freely obtain and use these tools so that you can have what you need for that first interview: experience and a passion for security. This is a green talk for people who don't have a clue on what offensive and defensive people do operationally, from a tool perspective.

			* [So you think you want to be a penetration tester - Defcon24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be7bvZkgFmY)
				* So, you think you want to be a penetration tester, or you already are and don't understand what the difference between you and all the other "so called" penetration testers out there. Think you know the difference between a Red Team, Penetration Test and a Vulnerability assessment? Know how to write a report your clients will actually read and understand? Can you leverage the strengths of your team mates to get through tough roadblocks, migrate, pivot, pwn and pillage? No? well this talk is probably for you then! We will go through the fascinating, intense and often crazily boring on-site assessment process. Talk about planning and performing Red Teams, how they are different, and why they can be super effective and have some fun along the way. I'll tell you stories that will melt your face, brain and everything in between. Give you the answers to all of your questions you never knew you had, and probably make you question your life choices. By the end of this session you will be ready to take your next steps into the job you've always wanted, or know deep inside that you should probably look for something else. There will be no judgment or shame, only information, laughter and fun.

	* [The Gervais Principle - RibbonFarm](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/the-gervais-principle/)
	* [Peter Principle - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle)
		* The Peter principle is a concept in management developed by Laurence J. Peter, which observes that people in a hierarchy tend to rise to their "level of incompetence". In other words, employees are promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another. The concept was enunciated in the 1969 book The Peter Principle by Peter and Raymond Hull.
		* It was originally written as a satire.
	* [Dilbert Principle - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert_principle)
		* The Dilbert principle refers to a 1990s theory by Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams stating that companies tend to systematically promote their least competent employees to management (generally middle management), to limit the amount of damage they are capable of doing.
	* [The Iron Law of Bureaucracy](https://www.jerrypournelle.com/reports/jerryp/iron.html)
		* Pournelle's Iron Law of Bureaucracy states that in any bureaucratic organization there will be two kinds of people":
			* `First, there will be those who are devoted to the goals of the organization. Examples are dedicated classroom teachers in an educational bureaucracy, many of the engineers and launch technicians and scientists at NASA, even some agricultural scientists and advisors in the former Soviet Union collective farming administration.`
			* `Secondly, there will be those dedicated to the organization itself. Examples are many of the administrators in the education system, many professors of education, many teachers union officials, much of the NASA headquarters staff, etc.`
		* The Iron Law states that in every case the second group will gain and keep control of the organization. It will write the rules, and control promotions within the organization.

	* [What senior engineers do: fix knowledge holes - Dan Moore](http://www.mooreds.com/wordpress/archives/3232)
		* Worthwhile for the first comment in response to the article: "I don’t see anything “senior” about it, or even “engineer”.  Seeing problems and solving them is what everyone does.  Documenting the solution is one part of solving a problem.  An apprentice carpenter does these things, too, and so does a farmer, and a waiter.  Unfortunately, it’s not what most software companies reward, or how they operate.  Whenever I did this, my manager, at every software company I’ve worked for, would say:  “That’s cool, but you’re supposed to add the FooBar feature, and it needs to be done this Friday.  Don’t waste time with reverse-engineering, or documentation.  Just add one new field to the protocol somewhere.  We can clean it up Later(TM).”  This is Conway’s Law at work.  What sort of company encourages the creation of two critical components which are completely undocumented?  The sort of company which doesn’t reward documentation of critical components.  That’s not likely to change because the engineer that created them happened to leave.  (It took more time to reverse-engineer the protocol than it would have to document it when the knowledge was fresh.)  The PM and QA who allowed this to happen are still there, right?  What “Senior Engineer” really means is someone who’s spent enough time in the trenches to have earned a job title that allows them the latitude to make these sorts of improvements, and not have a PM question why they aren’t, instead, doing exactly what they were assigned.  Look back at the story.  Did the “senior engineer” go through proper channels to schedule a “reverse-engineer and document network protocol” task?  No, he clearly didn’t trust that it would happen.  Or maybe it was already there, but lowest priority (way below “fix CSS on IE”, of course).  What was his actual responsibility that week?  The story doesn’t say, but I don’t see any remarks about a PM breathing down his neck asking about the CSS fix he asked for (because that PM is the only user of the system, anywhere, of course, who uses IE and sees that particular bug).  Documentation is not on this week’s “Sprint”!  The process is fundamentally broken.  We hear fables like this about how life would be better if we all did something one way (you’ll get promoted to Senior Engineer!), while in practice we’re punished for doing so."
