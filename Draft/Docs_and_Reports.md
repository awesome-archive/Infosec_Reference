* **Writing**<a name="writing"></a>
	* Start with the first two links, and go from there. They’re both great resources to writing technical documentation, the first being a beginners guide and the second being a general guide that beginners can understand.

The ronn-format(7) manual page defines the format in detail.

		* **Talks**
			* [Hack for Show, Report for Dough - Brian B. King(WWHF 2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_LBWqNDY0M)
				* The fun part of pentesting is the hacking. But the part that makes it a viable career is the report. You can develop the most amazing exploit for the most surprising vulnerability, but if you can't document it clearly for the people who need to fix it, then you're just having fun. Which is fine! But if you want to make a career out of it, your reports need to be as clear and useful as your hacks are awesome. This talk shows simple techniques you can use to make your reports clear, useful, and brief. You'll see some before-and-after examples of a bad report made good, with clear explanations of what makes the difference. Those things will be useful no matter what tools you use to create reports. Then, if we have time, we'll look at some Microsoft Word hacks that will save you time and improve consistency.
