* [DevSecOps State of the Union - Clint Gibler(BSidesSF 2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AusPKzwNnMg)
	* Many companies have shared their lessons learned in scaling their security efforts, leading to hundreds of blog posts and conference talks. Sharing knowledge is fantastic, but when you're a busy AppSec engineer or manager struggling to keep up with day-to-day requirements, it can be difficult to stay on top of or even be aware of relevant research. This talk will summarize and distill the unique tips and tricks, lessons learned, and tools discussed in a vast number of blog posts and conference talks over the past few years and combine it with knowledge gained from in-person discussions with AppSec engineers at a number of companies with mature security teams. Topics covered will include: Principles, mindsets, and methodologies of highly effective AppSec teams, Best practices in developing security champions and building a positive security culture, High value engineering projects that can prevent classes of bugs, How and where to integrate security automation into the CI/CD process in a high signal, low noise way, Open source tools that help with one or more of the above. Attendees will leave this talk with an understanding of the current state of the art in DevSecOps, links to tools they can use, resources where they can dive into specific topics of interest, and most importantly an actionable path forward for taking their security program to the next level.

	* PHP-7 is a new version of the most prevalent server-side language in use today. Like previous version, this version is also vulnerable to memory corruptions. However, the language has gone through extensive changes and none of previous exploitation techniques are relevant. In this talk, we explore the new memory internals of the language from exploiters and vulnerability researchers point of view. We will explain newly found vulnerabilities in the 'unserialize' mechanism of the language and present re-usable primitives for remote exploitation of these vulnerabilities.

	* [How to be a Programmer: Community Version](https://github.com/braydie/HowToBeAProgrammer)
		* To be a good programmer is difficult and noble. The hardest part of making real a collective vision of a software project is dealing with one's coworkers and customers. Writing computer programs is important and takes great intelligence and skill. But it is really child's play compared to everything else that a good programmer must do to make a software system that succeeds for both the customer and myriad colleagues for whom he or she is partially responsible. In this essay I attempt to summarize as concisely as possible those things that I wish someone had explained to me when I was twenty-one.

		* There are many ways you can test your software: unit testing, manual testing, end-to-end testing, and so forth. Take a step back and you'll discover even more form of testing, many of them very different in their goals: A/B testing, say, where you see which of two versions of your website results in more signups or ad clicks. How do these forms of testing differ, how do they relate to each other? How do you choose which kind of testing to pursue, given limited time and resources? How do you deal with strongly held yet opposite views arguing either that a particular kind of testing is essential or that it's a waste time? This talk will provide you with a model, a way to organize all forms of testing and understand what exactly they provide, and why. Once you understand the model you will be able to choose the right form of testing for *your* situation and goals.
	* [When to Test and How to Test It - Bruce Potter - Derbycon7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej97WyEMRkI)
		* “I think we need a penetration test” This is one of the most misunderstood phrases in the security community. It can mean anything from “Someone should run a vulnerability scan against a box” to “I’d like nation-state capable actors to tell me everything that wrong with my enterprise” and everything in between. Security testing is a complex subject and it can be hard to understand what the best type of testing is for a given situation. This talk will examine the breadth of software security testing. From early phase unit and abuse testing to late phase penetration testing, this talk will provide details on the different tests that can be performed, what to expect from the testing, and how to select the right tests for your situation. Test coverage, work effort, attack simulation, and reporting results will be discussed. Also, this talk will provide a process for detailed product assessments, i.e.: if you’ve got a specific product you’re trying to break, how do you approach assessing the product in a way that maximizes your chance of breaking in as well as maximizing the coverage you will get from your testing activity.

* **Tools**
	* [RIPS](http://rips-scanner.sourceforge.net/)
		* RIPS is a tool written in PHP to find vulnerabilities in PHP applications using static code analysis. By tokenizing and parsing all source code files RIPS is able to transform PHP source code into a program model and to detect sensitive sinks (potentially vulnerable functions) that can be tainted by user input (influenced by a malicious user) during the program flow. Besides the structured output of found vulnerabilities RIPS also offers an integrated code audit framework for further manual analysis.
	* [PHPMD - PHP Mess Detector](http://phpmd.org/about.html)  
		* What PHPMD does is: It takes a given PHP source code base and look for several potential problems within that source. These problems can be things like: Possible bugs; Suboptimal code; Overcomplicated expressions; Unused parameters, methods, properties.
	* [PMD](http://pmd.sourceforge.net/)
		* PMD is a source code analyzer. It finds common programming flaws like unused variables, empty catch blocks, unnecessary object creation, and so forth.

		* Graudit is a simple script and signature sets that allows you to find potential  security flaws in source code using the GNU utility grep. It's comparable to  other static analysis applications like RATS, SWAAT and flaw-finder while  keeping the technical requirements to a minimum and being very flexible.
	* [cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc)
		* cloc counts blank lines, comment lines, and physical lines of source code in many programming languages.
	* [CRASS](https://github.com/floyd-fuh/crass)
		* The "code review audit script scanner" (CRASS) started as a source code grep-er with a set of selected high-potential strings that may result in (security) problems. By now it is searching for strings that are interesting for analysts. Simplicity is the key: You don't need anything than a couple of standard `*nix` command line tools (especially grep), while the project still serves as a "what can go wrong" collection of things we see over the years.

		* Abstract — Lua is an interpreted, cross-platform, embeddable, performant and low-footprint language. Lua’s popularity is on the rise in the last couple of years. Simple design and efficient usage of resources combined with its performance make it attractive or production web applications even to big organizations such as Wikipedia, CloudFlare and GitHub. In addition to this, Lua is one of the preferred choices for programming embedded and IoT devices. This context allows to assume a large and growing Lua codebase yet to be assessed. This growing Lua codebase could be potentially driving production servers and extremely large number of devices, some perhaps with mission-critical function for example in automotive or home-automation domains. However, there is a substantial and obvious lack of static analysis tools and vulnerable code corpora for Lua as compared to other increasingly popular languages, such as PHP, Python and JavaScript. Even the state-of-the-art commercial tools that support dozens of languages and technologies actually do not support Lua static code analysis. In this paper we present the first public Static Analysis for SecurityTesting (SAST) tool for Lua code that is currently focused on web vulnerabilities. We show its potential with good and promising preliminary results that we obtained on simple and intentionally vulnerable Lua code samples that we synthesized for our experiments. We also present and release our synthesized corpus of intentionally vulnerable Lua code, as well as the testing setups used in our experiments in form of virtual and completely reproducible environments. We hope our work can spark additional and renewed interest in this apparently overlooked area of language security and static analysis, as well as motivate community’s contribution to these open-source projects. The tool, the samples and the testing VM setups will be released and updated at http://lua.re and http://lua.rocks

			* Python is a popular language and that is true as well within the Security industry. This talk will outline how Python code can be statically analyzed using publicly available tools such as bandit. It will then take a more technical approach and outline how the abstract syntax tree (AST) can be processed and searched based on behavior clues to identify potential security issues. Many security tools search for vulnerabilities by analyzing the contents of static strings and examining their variable names. This alternative approach instead demonstrates how the AST can be analyzed to identify pieces of sensitive information such as encryption keys and passwords based on matching them with usage patterns. This will be a technical talk focused on using automated techniques to find security vulnerabilities in Python projects. The audience will leave with an understanding of these techniques and how they can be applied to the projects they are either developing themselves or using in their daily routines. This talk will end with a live demonstration of a forked version of the public Bandit scanner where these techniques have been implemented.

But sometimes, the outcomes of a Python snippet may not seem obvious to a regular user at first sight.  Here is a fun project to collect such tricky & counter-intuitive examples and lesser-known features in Python, attempting to discuss what exactly is happening under the hood!  While some of the examples you see below may not be WTFs in the truest sense, but they'll reveal some of the interesting parts of Python that you might be unaware of. I find it a nice way to learn the internals of a programming language, and I think you'll find them interesting as well!  If you're an experienced Python programmer, you can take it as a challenge to get most of them right in first attempt. You may be already familiar with some of these examples, and I might be able to revive sweet old memories of yours being bitten by these gotchas sweat_smile

		* Construct is a powerful declarative parser (and builder) for binary data.  Instead of writing imperative code to parse a piece of data, you declaratively define a data structure that describes your data. As this data structure is not code, you can use it in one direction to parse data into Pythonic objects, and in the other direction, convert ("build") objects into binary data.

Packets can be constructed from scratch, as well as parsed from raw data, and the object oriented API makes it simple to work with deep hierarchies of protocols. The library provides a set of tools as examples of what can be done within the context of this library.

		* This is a fork of scapy (http://www.secdev.org) to make it compatible with python3. Fork based on scapy v2.3.1 All tests from regression (758 tests), ipsec, and both other test suites pass. Also, I tested full tutorial series [Building Network Tools with Scapy by @thepacketgeek](http://thepacketgeek.com/series/building-network-tools-with-scapy/) using scapy-python3. Please, submit all issues https://github.com/phaethon/scapy preferrably with .pcap files for tests. Bugs for individual layers are usually easy to fix.

		* Tiny snippet of code that pulls ASCII shellcode from pastebin and executes it. The purpose of this is to have a minimal amount of benign code so AV doesn't freak out, then it pulls down the evil stuff. People have been doing this kind of stuff for years so I take no credit for the concept. That being said, this code (or similar code) works surprisingly often during pentests when conventional malware fails.
